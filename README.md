If you attempt to run npm install inside the ClientApp, please make sure you do so by using the **--force and/or --legacy-peer-deps** tags after.<br/>

5) Wait for the project to build. You might need to repeat step 4 after it finishes building the first time in order for it to open in the browser effectively. (NOTE: If the project fails to run npm install, make sure your WiFi connection is running only on IPV4. That solves the issue sometimes. Here's a <a href="https://networking.grok.lsu.edu/article.aspx?articleid=17573" target="_blank">tutorial</a> for that in case of need).
