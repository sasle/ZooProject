# ABOUT
Simple project following the rules set in the PDF, with a integration between front (React) and backend (.NET MVC) and using dependecy injection alongside other best practices on both.<br/>The main theme of the project is exhibiting zoo animals and also more info about them (plus other features requested in the email).

# DISCLAIMER
The reason I have developed in 2 accounts (sasle and asantos-integration) is because of a network issue in my personal computer which blocked me from running npm scripts and installing some modules. For this reason, I had to continue part of the development in my current company's working machine, which is logged in as asantos-integration.

# DISCLAIMER 2
If you attempt to run npm install inside the ClientApp, please make sure you do so by using the --force or --legacy-peer-deps tags after.

# USAGE GUIDE
To run this project, please follow these steps:
1) Clone the project;
2) In Visual Studio, Open the .sln file located inside the root of the project;
3) In the debugger options, select IIS Express<br/>

5) Wait for the project to build. You might need to repeat step 4 after it finishes building the first time in order for it to open in the browser effectively. (NOTE: If the project fails to run npm install, make sure your WiFi connection is running only on IPV4. That solves the issue sometimes. Here's a <a href="https://networking.grok.lsu.edu/article.aspx?articleid=17573" target="_blank">tutorial</a> for that in case of need).

# CONCLUSION
Hope you enjoy my project! I am completely available for any questions you might have. Please feel free to contact me via email (sasle57@gmail.com) or phone (+55 11 99657-3771). Excited for any news to come!<br/>
Best regards,<br>
Alexandre.
